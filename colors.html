    <!-- This section is geared towards working with the css color properties. A css color can be specified using the predefined color name, or the RGB value, The HSL value OR the HEX value.
     
    PREDEFINED COLOR VALUES
    The predefined color name has values such as: red, green, blue, purple, dodgerblue, rebeccapurple etc. 
    RGB VALUES
    The RGB value is the amount of red, green and blue in the color.  It starts off with a value of 0 which is black and then ends with 255 which is white. It is represented like so, RGB(255,255, 255) color white is gotten by setting the RGB TO 255 and color black is gotten by setting all values to 0 like so: RGB(0,0,0); RGB value can also have an alpha channel which shows its opacity value  like so: RGBA(0, 45, 70, 0.8); The color has an opacity of 80% which is 0.8.

    HEX VALUES
    Also known as hexadecimal values is a six letter code that represents a specific color. It is represented by adding a hash sign before the letters like so: #ffffff and #000000, f represents white and 0 represents black respectively. We can understand this more when we relate it to our RGB values. The first two letters in the hex code is ''R', the second two letters is 'G' and the third one is 'B'. Therefore, #ff0000 is Red, #00ff00 is green and #0000ff is blue. This can be mixed to represent other colors which is the amount of the color mixings of these RGB colors.

    HSL values
    In CSS, a color can be specified using hue, saturation, and lightness (HSL) in the form:
    
    hsl(hue, saturation, lightness)
    
    Hue is a degree on the color wheel from 0 to 360. 0 is red, 120 is green, and 240 is blue.
    
    Saturation is a percentage value. 0% means a shade of gray, and 100% is the full color.
    
    Lightness is also a percentage. 0% is black, 50% is neither light or dark, 100% is white

    There is also an alpha channel which represents the opacity or transparency, identified by an 'a'.
    
    hsla(0, 2%, 6%, 0.5); -->
