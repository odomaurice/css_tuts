    <!-- Media queries are used to determine the responsiveness of a web application to various mobile sizes and gadget sizes. The way it works is that a rule is set including a set of css properties which are to be met only if the condition is true. This rule is realized by adding breakpoints of various screen sizes which are  small(>576px), medium(>768px), large(>992px) and extra-large( > 1200px). 

   It uses the @media rule followed by set of conditions including the breakpoint, element to be changed and what character of the element to be changed. Let's look at an illustration in our css file. -->
