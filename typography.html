        <!-- CSS Typography has to to with how texts are represented and applied. Texts are one of the places that catch the eye when users visit various websites. Some texts are meant to pass information to the user and others are just plain texts that serve decoration purposes. Therefore, it is necessary to take into consideration, what each text represents and the best way to apply styles to it. To do this, we have to take into consideration the style of the text(font style), the text class or family(font family), whether they should be upper or lowercase or capitalized(text decoration), If they are to be underlined, crossed-over or overlined(text-transform), if they should be at the center or to the left or right(text-align), how big or small the text should be(font-size) and many more. -->
